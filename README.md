## Understanding The Difference Between GP, CGP & CGPA

Grades, Grade Point Average (GPA), and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) are all related to academic performance and are commonly used in educational institutions to assess a student's achievements. However, there are distinct differences between these terms. Let's explore each one:

**Grades**: Grades are individual assessments given for each course or subject based on the student's performance. Grades are typically represented by letters such as A, B, C, D, E, and F (or similar variations), and they indicate the level of achievement or proficiency in that specific course. Grades can also be assigned numerical values, known as Grade Points (GP), to calculate GPA and CGPA.

**Grade Point Average (GPA)**: GPA is a measure of a student's overall academic performance for a specific period, such as a semester or academic year. It is calculated by assigning numerical values (Grade Points) to the grades obtained in each course and then averaging those values. GPA provides an overview of a student's performance during a specific timeframe and helps determine academic standing or honors. GPA is typically calculated on a scale of `0.00 to 5.00` or `0.00 to 4.00`, although it may vary depending on the grading system used by the institution, but most institution in Nigeria uses `0.00 to 5.00` also Federal University Gusau (FUGUS) used `0.00 to 5.00`.

**Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)**: CGPA represents the cumulative or overall academic performance of a student throughout their entire academic program or a specific period, such as their entire undergraduate degree. It takes into account the grades obtained in all courses completed over multiple semesters or academic years. CGPA is calculated by summing up the Grade Points earned in all courses and dividing that sum by the total number of credit hours or credit units completed. CGPA provides a comprehensive measure of a student's academic achievements and is often used for evaluating eligibility for graduation, honors, or academic recognition.

In summary, GP refers to the numerical values assigned to individual grades, GPA represents the average performance for a specific period, and CGPA reflects the cumulative average of grades earned over an entire academic program. Understanding these distinctions is important for students to track their progress accurately and for institutions to evaluate academic performance consistently.

## CGPA at FUGUS

The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is a numerical representation of your academic performance at FUGUS. It is calculated based on the grades you receive in each course over the duration of your studies. The CGPA scale at FUGUS ranges from 0.00 to 5.00.

Each course at FUGUS is assigned a specific number of credit units, which represent the weight or value of the course. The credit units reflect the amount of time and effort required to complete the course successfully. Grades are assigned to each course based on your performance, and these grades are then used to calculate your CGPA.

## Calculating CGPA at FUGUS

To calculate your CGPA at FUGUS, you need to follow these steps:

1. Assign Grade Points: Each grade at FUGUS corresponds to a specific Grade Point (GP). The table below shows the FUGUS grading system and the corresponding GP values:

```sh
Grade 	 Grade   Point	Percentage
A        5.00    70-100
B        4.00    60-69.99
C        3.00    50-59.99
D        2.00    45-49.99
E        1.00    40-44.99
F        0.00    0-39.99
```

2. Calculate Grade Points: Multiply the GP value for each course by the credit units assigned to that course. For example, if you received a grade of B (4.00 GP) in a course with 3 credit units, the grade points earned for that course would be 4.00 x 3 = 12.00.

3. Sum of Grade Points: Add up the grade points earned for all the courses you have completed.

4. Total Credit Units: Calculate the total credit units earned by summing up the credit units for all the courses completed.

5. Calculate CGPA: Divide the sum of grade points by the total credit units earned. The result is your CGPA.
